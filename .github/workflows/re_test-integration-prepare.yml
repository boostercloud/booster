      # This step will upload all the files in the `packages/framework-integration-tests/.booster` folder
      # to the GitHub Actions artifacts. This is needed because the integration tests are run in a different
      # job, and we need to pass the dependencies to it. The artifact is suffixed with the name of the git
      # commit, so that we can have multiple artifacts for the same branch. Those will be deleted after
      # 1 day. It is also useful because these dependencies could be downloaded by the user to run the
      # integration tests locally, or even test their own Booster applications with this version.
