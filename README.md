## Disclaimer

Current published versions of Booster are pre-release versions under heavy development. This means that a good chunk of the most
basic functionality that you’d expect in a production-ready framework might be missing or in a very buggy state and the documentation
might not be totally accurate. It’s also very likely that non-backward-compatible changes will be introduced on new releases until
the project reaches a stable version.

Refer to [Release Notes](https://github.com/boostercloud/booster/releases) for more specific information about what's supported on each iteration.

## Overview

Booster is a high-level framework for _TypeScript_ to build _Serverless_ applications with built-in business-logic-level abstractions.

Serverless architectures have great advantages (especially regarding scalability) useful for any production-grade application, but they also
present some important challenges (mainly related to complexity).

If a genie gave us three Serverless wishes, we would ask for:

- Smoother learning curves beyond the getting-started guide.
- Easy-to-use conventions and standards for common recurrent problems.
- Higher-level abstractions that make it easier to represent business rules in the cloud.

Booster provides a set of highly opinionated conventions and sensible defaults to automatically build and provision the
cloud architecture needed to run your projects without asking you to write any configuration at all.
In fact, the configuration is inferred _automatically_ from the code you write.
