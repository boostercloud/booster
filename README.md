## Disclaimer

Booster is a pre-release framework under heavy development, so non-backward-compatible changes might be introduced until we reach v1.0.0.

Refer to [Release Notes](https://github.com/boostercloud/booster/releases) for more specific information about changes of each iteration.

## Overview

Booster is a high-level framework for _TypeScript_ to build _Serverless_ applications with built-in business-logic-level abstractions.

Serverless architectures have great advantages (especially regarding scalability) useful for any production-grade application, but they also
present some important challenges (mainly related to complexity).

If a genie gave us three Serverless wishes, we would ask for:

- Smoother learning curves beyond the getting-started guide.
- Easy-to-use conventions and standards for common recurrent problems.
- Higher-level abstractions that make it easier to represent business rules in the cloud.

Booster provides a set of highly opinionated conventions and sensible defaults to automatically build and provision the
cloud architecture needed to run your projects without asking you to write any configuration at all.
In fact, the configuration is inferred _automatically_ from the code you write.
