/*
 * This module exposed testing utilities for working with Effect services in tests.
 *
 * If you don't even know what Effect is, you probably should start by reading the docs
 * in the `@boostercloud/framework-types/dist/effect` module.
 *
 * The key idea is that you can create a mock service that can be used in tests
 * instead of the real service. This allows you to test your code without
 * depending on the real service, nor having to replace functions of libraries with mocks.
 *
 * When testing services, we don't need to ensure that the service is actually calling
 * the real implementation. We just need to ensure that the service is calling the
 * right functions with the right arguments. That is, unless we're testing the live
 * implementation, which is the only case where it is acceptable to replace the
 * library functions with a mock.
 */

/**
 * Main entry point of the Effect testing helper module.
 * You pass the tag for your service, and a record of mocks for the functions. This function will
 * return a helper object that contains a `Layer` that you can use to replace the service in your
 * tests, the fakes record that you passed, and a `reset` function that will reset the history
 * of all the fakes, so you can use them in multiple tests.
 *
 * A useful pattern is to create a `makeTestService` function that will create a new instance of
 * the service for each test, passing the overrides you need for that test. This way, you can
 * use the same `makeTestService` function in multiple tests, and you don't need to be passing all
 * the fakes in every test.
 *
 * NOTE: This has a limitation where the service cannot define constants or values that are effects,
 * as a workaround, you can define them as functions that return the value.
 *
 * E.g.:
 * `() => Effect<...>`  instead of `Effect<...>`
 *
 * and
 *
 * `() => Effect<..., T>` instead of `T`
 *
 * @example
 * Here's the typical usage of this function (you can also check the tests in the @boostercloud/cli package):
 * ```typescript
 * import { fakeService, FakeOverrides } from '@boostercloud/application-tester/src/effect'
 * import { fake } from 'sinon'
 * import { MyService } from '../../../src/services/my-service'
 *
 * const makeTestMyService = (overrides?: FakeOverrides<MyService>) =>
 *   fakeService(MyService, {
 *     voidMethodInService: fake(),
 *     methodThatReturnsAValue: fake.returns(''),
 *     ...overrides,
 *   })
 *
 * // In your test:
 * describe('my test', () => {
 *   it('should do something', async () => {
 *     const { layer, fakes, reset } = makeTestMyService()
 *
 *     await unsafeRunEffect(functionThatUsesMyService(), {
 *       layer,
 *       onError: orDie
 *     })
 *
 *     expect(fakes.methodThatReturnsAValue).to.have.been.calledWith('some value')
 *     reset()  // You can also reset the fakes in an `afterEach` hook
 *   })
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @param tag - The tag of the service to fake. E.g. `ProcessService`.
 * @param fakes - A record of the methods to fake. E.g. `{ cwd: fake.returns(''), exec: fake.returns('') }`.
 * @return {FakeServiceUtils} - An object with the layer to use in the dependency graph, and the fakes to assert the service was called with the right parameters.
