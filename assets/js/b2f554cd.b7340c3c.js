These kinds of proposals are **seen as completely out of the scope of the Booster project and will be instantly dismissed.**\\n- **Use constructive criticism.** Instead of \\"remove this, I don\'t like it\\", take a moment to think and give actual reasons like \\"I believe that this function in the standard library is not clear enough, someone could understand this in a wrong way\\"\\n- Is the problem being addressed **impactful enough** to warrant a change to Booster?\\n- How does this impact the [**Principle of Least Astonishment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) of the project?\\n- How does this impact the [**Principle of Developer Happiness**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/09/22/ensuring-developer-happiness-how-to-hang-on-to-software-engineers) of the project?\\n- How does this impact the [**Principle of Least Effort**](https://simplicable.com/design/principle-of-least-effort) of the project? Both externally for the users and internally for the maintainers.\\n- Does this proposal fit well with the **feel and direction** of Booster?\\n- What **other libraries/languages** got you inspired to submit this proposal? How does this compare to those?\\n- How much **effort** did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?\\n\\nPlease **state explicitly** whether you believe that the proposal should be accepted into Booster."}]}')}}]);
