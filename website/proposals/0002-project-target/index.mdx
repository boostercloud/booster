## Introduction

This document defines the target audience and [user persona](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)>) for the Booster Framework project, aligning it with its current usage and user base.

While maintaining a focus on guiding the design and development process of the Booster Framework, this definition is not an exclusionary rule but a strategic tool for decision-making. The framework is inclusive and welcomes a diverse range of users, though particular emphasis is placed on specific user groups in design and functionality.

## Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Booster Framework is developers in large-scale enterprise environments, familiar with enterprise technologies like Java, .NET, or similar. This includes those working in Fortune 500 companies, especially those transitioning from traditional enterprise technologies to TypeScript in complex projects such as financial transactions.

Additionally, the Booster Framework is gaining traction among hobbyist developers for personal projects, thanks to its ease of use and efficient learning curve. This secondary audience appreciates the framework for its quick setup, minimal configuration, and straightforward deployment, which are ideal for smaller-scale, personal projects.

### Who's not the target audience

- Developers deeply invested in exploring advanced theoretical concepts in programming without practical application.
- Those who prefer frameworks with a steep learning curve or require extensive configuration.
