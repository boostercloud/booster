# Provider Configuration

Booster applications are deployed to the cloud using the provider's API. Each provider has its own configuration parameters. This section describes how to configure each provider.

## Local Provider

All Booster projects come with a local development environment configured by default, so you can test your app before deploying it to the cloud.

You can see the configured local environment in your `src/config/config.ts` file:

```typescript
Booster.configure('local', (config: BoosterConfig): void => {
  config.appName = 'my-store'
  config.providerPackage = '@boostercloud/framework-provider-local'
})
```

In order to start your application using the local provider, use the following command:

```bash
boost start -e local
```

Where `local` is one of your defined environments with the `Booster.configure` call.

## AWS Provider Setup

Booster is a cloud-native framework, meaning that your application
will be deployed to the cloud using different cloud providers. By default, Booster uses the
[AWS Provider](04_features.md#aws-provider), so you need an AWS account.

:::caution
Booster is free to use, but remember that the resources deployed to your cloud provider
might generate some expenses.

In AWS, all the resources generated by Booster are part of the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).
When you're not eligible for the free tier, resources are charged on-demand. Deploying a
Booster project and sending a few commands and queries should cost just a few cents.

In any case, make sure to un-deploy your application with the command `boost nuke -e production`
if you're not planning to keep using it.
:::

Now it is a good time to create that AWS account, you can do so from
[the AWS console registration](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

Once you've registered yourself, you have to generate an access key for Booster. To do so,
login into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), and click on your account
name on the top-right corner.

![aws account menu location](/img/aws-account-menu.png)

A menu will open, click on **My security credentials** and it will take you to the
Identity and Access Management panel. Once there, create an access key:

![create access key button location](/img/aws-create-access-key.png)

A pop-up like the following will appear, **don't close it!**.

![credentials pop up](/img/aws-credentials.png)

Using data from that pop-up, create a folder called `.aws` under your home
folder, and a file inside called `credentials` with this syntax:

```ini
  ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR ACCESS KEY ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>
```

> You can see more details in the [Providers configuration](going-deeper.md#providers-configuration) section.

### Multiple AWS Accounts

**Declaring Region**

If you'd like to use multiple AWS account profiles (in place of or in addition to your
default profile) you will need to also set a `region` option for each one to let the AWS SDK
know which region to deploy to. To do this, you have two options:

- Add the region to the profile of your choice in your `~/.aws/credentials` file

```ini
  ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <DEFAULT ACCESS KEY ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <DEFAULT SECRET ACCESS KEY>
region=<DEFAULT REGION>

[other_profile] Give this profile the name that works best for you
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR ACCESS KEY ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>
region=<REGION FOR YOUR BOOSTER APP>
```

- Or create a `~/.aws/config` file

```ini
  ~/.aws/config
[default]
region=<DEFAULT REGION>

[profile other_profile] You can rename the profile in any way that works for you
region=<REGION FOR YOUR BOOSTER APP>
```

**Switching Profiles**

To change the AWS profile you use to deploy or nuke you need to export
the profile in your current `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. This is done
within your current terminal session with the following command –

```shell
$ export AWS_PROFILE=other_profile
```

:::caution
When you are switching profiles by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable,
you will need to ensure you **do not** have values curently set for either the
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` variables. If these have values assigned,
they will take precedence over any keys set within the current `AWS_PROFILE` profile.

You can check if `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` have variables assigned
by checking all current AWS variables -

```shell
$ env | grep AWS
```

Or by checking these variables explicitly –

```shell
$ echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
$ echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

If values are present for `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` you can
clear them by unsetting them –

```shell
$ unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
$ unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```

:::

Selecting different profiles can be done manually, for each deploy or nuke, as
shown above, or you can create scripts within your package.json to set these
values at the same time as you deploy or nuke an environment. For example, below
we are creating scripts that set a different AWS profile to be used for 'development'
and 'production environments –

```json
~/package.json
...
"scripts": {
    "deploy-dev": "AWS_PROFILE=profileOne boost deploy -e development",
    "deploy-prod": "AWS_PROFILE=profileTwo boost deploy -e production",
    "nuke-dev": "AWS_PROFILE=profileOne boost nuke -e development",
    "nuke-prod": "AWS_PROFILE=profileTwo boost nuke -e production",
    "lint:check": "eslint --ext '.js,.ts' **/*.ts",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --quiet --fix --ext '.js,.ts' **/*.ts",
    "build": "ttsc -b tsconfig.json",
    "clean": "rimraf ./dist tsconfig.tsbuildinfo",
    "test": "AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=true BOOSTER_ENV=test nyc --extension .ts mocha --forbid-only \"test/**/*.test.ts\""
  },
...
```

These custom scripts are used in the same fashion as other scripts, for example –

```shell
npm run deploy-dev
```

## Azure Provider Setup

This step is only necessary in the case that you want to use the Azure Provider.

:::note
Azure has experimental support and the team is currently improving them.

:::caution

Booster is free to use, but remember that the resources deployed to your cloud provider
might generate some expenses.

In Azure, when you're not eligible for the free tier, resources are charged on-demand. Deploying a
Booster project and sending a few commands and queries should cost just a few cents.

In any case, make sure to un-deploy your application with the command `boost nuke -e production`
if you're not planning to keep using it.

Now is a good time to create that Microsoft Azure account. You can do so from [the Microsoft SingUp page](https://signup.live.com/). Then you can go to your Azure account in this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com).

Once you have created the Azure account, you need to install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on your computer, by following the instructions in the Azure CLI documentation.

Apart from that, you need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) on your system.

The final step consists of signing in to your Azure account from the Azure CLI:

```shell
az login
```

You can check the different login options in this [reference document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

Once you are logged in from the CLI, you can deploy applications with Booster.

> You can see more details in the [Providers configuration](05_going-deeper.md#providers-configuration) section.

## Kubernetes Provider Setup

This step is only necessary in the case that you want to use the Kubernetes provider.

:::note
Kubernetes has experimental support and the team is currently improving them.
:::

The main requirement is having a Kubernetes Cluster already configured. This provider has been succesfully tested in EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service), AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine). Since Kubernetes is a standard, this provider can also work in other Kubernetes clusters, including on-premises configurations.

:::caution
Booster is free to use, but remember that the Kubernetes cluster resources used for the deployment
might generate some expenses.
:::

Additionally, it is also required to install **kubectl** and [Helm](https://helm.sh). The required **Helm** version is 3 or greater.

Please note that the desired cluster should be accessible from the kubectl command and you can successfully run:

```shell
kubectl get pods -A
```

> You can see more details in the [Providers configuration](05_going-deeper.md#providers-configuration) section.
