# Remove events

This is an experimental functionality. Please note that this functionality is only supported by Azure and Local providers.

Booster allows to delete past events and their related entities as to update the affected ReadModels.

By using the `Booster.deleteEvent` command it is possible to indicate the event to be deleted. To do so, you must indicate:

* entityID: The `id` of the entity of the event to be deleted
* entityTypeName: The entity type name of the event entity to be deleted
* createdAt: The date of creation of the event.

Example:
```typescript
import { Booster, Command } from '@boostercloud/framework-core'
import { EventDeleteParameters } from '@boostercloud/framework-types'

@Command({
  authorize: 'all',
})
export class HardDelete {
  public constructor(readonly entityId: string, readonly entityTypeName: string, readonly createdAt: string) {}

  public static async handle(command: HardDelete): Promise<boolean> {
    const parameters: EventDeleteParameters = {
      entityID: command.entityId,
      entityTypeName: command.entityTypeName,
      createdAt: command.createdAt,
    }
    return await Booster.deleteEvent(parameters)
  }
}
```

When executing this command, Booster will update the selected event in the corresponding database with an empty value and a deletion date.
This way, it will be reflected in the system that there was an event that was subsequently deleted.

Deleted events are ignored by Booster, but they can be accessed using the corresponding methods (`eventsByEntity` and `eventsByType`).

The entities associated with a deleted event will be permanently removed from the database.

ReadModels are not automatically modified or deleted and it is up to the user to act accordingly.
To do so, the methods annotated with `@Project` of the ReadModels have a third parameter `unProject` which allows to define a
function that will be executed when the entity defined in the projection and with the `joinKey` defined in the projection is deleted.

This third parameter will be a static function with the same parameters as the method we are projecting.

It is possible to use the same method that is used for projecting to resolve the deletions by simply specifying this
method as `unProject`.

Example:
```typescript
  @Projects(Pack, 'products', ProductReadModel.updateWithPack)
  public static updateWithPack(
    pack: Pack,
    readModelID: UUID,
    currentProductReadModel?: ProductReadModel,
    projectionInfo?: ProjectionInfo
  ): ProjectionResult<ProductReadModel> {
    if (projectionInfo?.reason === ProjectionInfoReason.ENTITY_DELETED) {
      return ReadModelAction.Delete
    }
    //   ... other code
  }
```

In this case, if the `Pack` entity with the joinKey `products` is deleted, the `updateWithPack` method will be executed and will include a last parameter called `projectionInfo`.
This parameter contains the `reason` field, which in this case will be set to `ENTITY_DELETED` to indicate that the entity is being deleted.

Another option is to define your own deletion method independent of the projection method. In case of deletion the method
called will be the newly defined method.

Example:
```typescript
  @Projects(Product, 'id', ProductReadModel.unProjectWithProduct)
  public static updateWithProduct(product: Product): ProjectionResult<ProductReadModel> {
    // ... other code
  }

  public static unProjectWithProduct(
    _product: Product,
    _currentProductReadModel?: ProductReadModel,
    _projectionInfo?: ProjectionInfo
  ): ProjectionResult<ProductReadModel> {
    return ReadModelAction.Delete
  }
```
