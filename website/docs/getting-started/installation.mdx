# Installation

You can develop with Booster using any of the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (Native and WSL)

## Booster Prerequisites

### Install Node.js

The minimal required Node.js version is `v14.14`. Download the installer
[from nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/en/), or install it using your system's package
manager.

<!-- For some strange reason, when using tabs, you need to remove the ident on the content -->

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, run the following command in your PowerShell

```shell
choco install nodejs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager, run the following command on the terminal

```shell
brew install node
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">
  
Just run the following commands on the terminal

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that it was installed properly by checking so from your terminal:

```shell
$ node -v
v14.14.0

$ npm -v
7.0.0
```

As soon as you have a Node.js version higher than `v14.14`, and an `npm` version higher than
`7`, you are good to go. Just note that `npm` comes with node, you don't have to install
it apart.

Alternatively, we recommend you to use a version manager for dealing with different Node.js
versions:

- [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Works with macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem
  for Linux
- [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - Works with native Windows

### Install Git

Booster will initialize a Git repository when you create a new project (unless you use the `--skipGit` flag), so it is required that you have it already installed in your system.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```shell
choco install git
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

```shell
brew install git
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```shell
sudo apt install git-all
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Git configuration variables

After installing git in your machine, make sure that `user.name` and `user.email` are properly configured.
Take a look at the [Git configuration page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for more info.

To configure them, run in your terminal:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

## Installing the Booster CLI

Booster comes with a command-line tool that helps you generating boilerplate code,
testing and deploying the application, and deleting all the resources in the cloud. All
the stable versions are published to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boostercloud/cli),
these versions are the recommended ones, as they are well documented, and the changes are
stated in the release notes.

To install the Booster CLI run this:

```shell
npm install --global @boostercloud/cli
```

Verify the Booster CLI installation with the `boost version` command. You should get back
something like

```shell
$ boost version
@boostercloud/cli/0.16.1 darwin-x64 node-v14.14.0
```
