# Read models

Read Models are cached data optimized for read operations. They're updated reactively when [Entities](03_booster-architecture#_4-entities-and-reducers) are updated after reducing [events](03_booster-architecture#_2-events). They also define the _Read API_.

Read Models are classes decorated with the `@ReadModel` decorator that have one or more projection methods.

```typescript
@ReadModel
export class ReadModelName {
  public constructor(readonly fieldA: SomeType, readonly fieldB: SomeType /* as many fields as needed */) {}

  @Projects(SomeEntity, 'entityField')
  public static projectionName(
    entity: SomeEntity,
    currentEntityReadModel?: ReadModelName
  ): ProjectionResult<ReadModelName> {
    return new ReadModelName(/* initialize here your constructor properties */)
  }

  @Projects(SomeEntity, 'othetEntityField')
  public static projectionName(
    entity: SomeEntity,
    currentEntityReadModel?: ReadModelName
  ): ProjectionResult<ReadModelName> {
    return new ReadModelName(/* initialize here your constructor properties */)
  }
  /* as many projections as needed */
}
```

## Read models naming convention

As it has been previously commented, semantics plays an important role in designing a coherent system and your application should reflect your domain concepts, we recommend choosing a representative domain name and use the `ReadModel` suffix in your read models name.

Despite you can place your read models in any directory, we strongly recommend you to put them in `<project-root>/src/read-models`. Having all the read models in one place will help you to understand your application's capabilities at a glance.

```text
<project-root>
├── src
│   ├── commands
│   ├── common
│   ├── config
│   ├── entities
│   ├── read-models  <------ put them here
│   ├── events
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── read-models
```

## Creating a read model

The preferred way to create a read model is by using the generator, e.g.

```shell
boost new:read-model CartReadModel --fields id:UUID cartItems:"Array<CartItem>" paid:boolean --projects Cart
```

The generator will create a Typescript class under the read-models directory `<project-root>/src/read-models/cart-read-model.ts`.

Read Model classes can also be created by hand and there are no restrictions. The structure of the data is totally open and can be as complex as you can manage in your projection functions.

## The projection function

A `Projection` is a method decorated with the `@Projects` decorator that, given a new entity value and (optionally) the current read model state, generate a new read model value.

Read models can be projected from one or more [entities](03_booster-architecture#_4-entities-and-reducers) as soon as all the entities involved have one field with the same semantics that can be used as a join key (usually an identifier or a reference to other entity). A join key in Booster is similar to join keys in relational databases, so you could see Read Models as reactive join operations that you can use to build data aggregates. When an entity is updated, Booster uses the join key to find the right read model instance, so all entities that share the same join key value will trigger the projections of the same read model. When defining a projection with the `@Projects` decorator, it's required to set the field name of the join key in each entity. Let's see an example:

```typescript
@ReadModel
export class UserReadModel {
  public constructor(readonly username: string /* ...(other interesting fields from users)... */) {}

  @Projects(User, 'id')
  public static projectUser(entity: User, current?: UserReadModel): ProjectionResult<UserReadModel> {
    // Here we update the user fields
  }

  @Projects(Post, 'ownerId')
  public static projectUserPost(entity: Post, current?: UserReadModel): ProjectionResult<UserReadModel> {
    //Here we can adapt the read model to show specific user information related with the Post entity
  }
}
```

In the previous example we are projecting the `User` entity using the user `id` and also we are projecting the `User` entity based on the `ownerId` of the `Post` entity. Notice that both join keys are references to the `User` identifier, but it's not required that the join key is an identifier.

You can even select arrays of UUIDs as `joinKey`, Booster will execute the projection for all the read models corresponding to those ids contained in the array (projections are completely isolated from each other). A subtle difference with non-array `joinKey` is the projection method signature. With array join keys, sometimes, we need extra information to know which is the read model we are projecting (especially for not yet existent read models, where the current argument is not present)
So, for example, if we would have a `Group` with an array of users in that group (`users: Array<UUID>`), we can have the following to update each `UserReadModel` accordingly:

```typescript
  @Projects(Group, 'users')
  public static projectUserGroup(entity: Group, readModelID: UUID, current?: UserReadModel): ProjectionResult<UserReadModel> {
    //Here we can update the read models with group information
    //This logic will be executed for each read model id in the array
  }
```

As you may have notice from the `ProjectionResult` type, projections can also return `ReadModelAction`, which includes:

1. Deletion of read models by returning the `ReadModelAction.Delete` value
2. You can also return `ReadModelAction.Nothing` to keep the read model untouched

```
@ReadModel
export class UserReadModel {
  public constructor(readonly username: string, /* ...(other interesting fields from users)... */) {}

  @Projects(User, 'id')
  public static projectUser(entity: User, current?: UserReadModel): ProjectionResult<UserReadModel>  {
    if (current?.deleted) {
      return ReadModelAction.Delete
    } else if (!current?.modified) {
      return ReadModelAction.Nothing
    }
    return new UserReadModel(...)
  }
```

## Authorizing read models

Read models are the tool to build the public read API of a Booster application, so you can define who is authorized to query and subscribe to them. The Booster authorization feature is covered in [the auth section](04_features#authentication-and-authorization). So far, we have seen that you can make a read model publicly accessible by authorizing `'all'` to query it or you can set specific roles providing an array of roles in this way: `authorize: [Admin]`.

## Querying a read model

For every read model, Booster automatically creates all the necessary queries and subscriptions. For example, given this `CartReadModel`:

```typescript
@ReadModel({
  authorize: 'all',
})
export class CartReadModel {
  public constructor(public id: UUID, readonly items: Array<CartItem>) {}

  @Projects(Cart, 'id')
  public static projectCart(entity: Cart, currentReadModel: CartReadModel): ProjectionResult<CartReadModel> {
    return new CartReadModel(entity.id, entity.items)
  }
}
```

You will get the following GraphQL query and subscriptions:

```graphQL
query CartReadModel(id: ID!): CartReadModel
subscription CartReadModel(id: ID!): CartReadModel
subscription CartReadModels(id: UUIDPropertyFilter!): CartReadModel
```

For more information about queries and how to use them, please check the [GraphQL API](04_features#reading-read-models) section.

## Time Sequenced Read Models

There are some use cases when it's desirable to model your read models as time sequences. An example could be building a chat app where all messages are identified by a specific channelID and a timestamp of when it was sent. Booster provides a special decorator to tag a specific property as a sequence key for a read model:

```typescript
export class MessageReadModel {
  public constructor(
    readonly id: UUID, // A channel ID
    @sequencedBy readonly timestamp: string,
    readonly contents: string
  )

  @Projects(Message, 'id')
  public static projectMessage(
    entity: Message,
    currentReadModel: MessageReadModel
  ): ProjectionResult<MessageReadModel> {
    return new MessageReadModel(entity.id, entity.timestamp, entity.contents)
  }
}
```

### Querying time sequences

Adding a sequence key to a read model changes the behavior of the singular query, which now accepts the sequence key as an optional parameter:

```graphQL
query MessageReadModel(id: ID!, timestamp: string): [MessageReadModel]
```

Using this query, when only the id is provided, you get an array of all the messages in the channel ordered by timestamp in ascending order (from older to newer). When you also provide an specific timestam, you still get an array, but it will only contain the message sent in that exact moment.

As the timestamp field is used as an index, it is important to guarantee that two messages never have the same timestamp value. In order to make it easier to generate unique timestamps, you can use the method `TimeKey.generate()`, which will generate timestamps with an UUID as a suffix to resolve any coincidences.

For more information about queries and how to use them, please check the [GraphQL API](04_features#reading-read-models) section.

## Getting real-time updates for a read model

Booster GraphQL API also provides support for real-time updates using subscriptions and a web-socket. To get more information about it go to the [GraphQL API](04_features#subscribing-to-read-models) section.

## Filtering a read model

The Booster GraphQL API provides support for filtering Read Models on `queries` and `subscriptions`. To get more information about it go to the [GraphQL API](04_features#filtering-a-read-model) section.
