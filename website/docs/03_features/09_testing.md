# Testing

Booster applications are fully tested by default. This means that you can be sure that your application will work as expected. However, you can also write your own tests to check that your application behaves as you expect. In this section, we will leave some recommendations on how to test your Booster application.

## Testing Booster applications

To properly test a Booster application, you should create a `test` folder at the same level as the `src` one. Apart from that, tests' names should have the `<my_test>.test.ts` format.

When a Booster application is generated, you will have a script in a `package.json` like this:
```typescript
"scripts": {
  "test": "nyc --extension .ts mocha --forbid-only \"test/**/*.test.ts\""
}
```

The only thing that you should add to this line are the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=true` and `BOOSTER_ENV=test` environment variables, so the script will look like this:

```typescript
"scripts": {
  "test": "AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=true BOOSTER_ENV=test nyc --extension .ts mocha --forbid-only \"test/**/*.test.ts\""
}
```

### Testing with `sinon-chai`

The `BoosterConfig` can be accessed through the `Booster.config` on any part of a Booster application. To properly mock it for your objective, we really recommend to use sinon `replace` method, after configuring your `Booster.config` as desired.

In the example below, we add 2 "empty" read-models, since we are iterating `Booster.config.readModels` from a command handler:

```typescript
// Test
import { replace } from 'sinon'

const config = new BoosterConfig('test')
config.appName = 'testing-time'
config.providerPackage = '@boostercloud/framework-provider-aws'
config.readModels['WoW'] = {} as ReadModelMetadata
config.readModels['Amazing'] = {} as ReadModelMetadata
replace(Booster, 'config', config)

const spyMyCall = spy(MyCommand, 'myCall')
const command = new MyCommand('1', true)
const register = new Register('request-id-1')
const registerSpy = spy(register, 'events')
await MyCommand.handle(command, register)

expect(spyMyCall).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly('WoW')
expect(spyMyCall).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly('Amazing')
expect(registerSpy).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly(new MyEvent('1', 'WoW'))
expect(registerSpy).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly(new MyEvent('1', 'Amazing'))
```

```typescript
// Example code
public static async handle(command: MyCommand, register: Register): Promise<void> {
  const readModels = Booster.config.readModels
  for (const readModelName in readModels) {
    myCall(readModelName)
    register.events(new MyEvent(command.ID, readModelName))
  }
}
```

### Recommended files

These are some files that might help you speed up your testing with Booster.

```typescript
// <root_dir>/test/expect.ts
import * as chai from 'chai'

chai.use(require('sinon-chai'))
chai.use(require('chai-as-promised'))

export const expect = chai.expect
```

This `expect` method will help you with some more additional methods like `expect(<my_stub>).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly(<my_params..>)`

```yaml
# <root_dir>/.mocharc.yml
diff: true
require: 'ts-node/register'
extension:
  - ts
package: './package.json'
recursive: true
reporter: 'spec'
timeout: 5000
full-trace: true
bail: true
```
