# Schedule actions

There are many cases in which you want to trigger some action periodically. For example, you may want to send a reminder email to a user every day at 10:00 AM. For this, you can use scheduled commands.

## Scheduled command

Commands represent an action. Therefore, the way to trigger an action periodically is by scheduling a command. Scheduled commands are the way to add automated tasks to your application, like cron jobs in other frameworks. Booster scheduled commands are TypeScript classes decorated with `@ScheduledCommand`. Unlike conventional commands, **the handle function doesn't have any parameters**.

In Booster, a scheduled command looks like this:

```typescript
@ScheduledCommand({
  minute: '0/5', // runs every 5 minutes
})
export class CheckCartCount {
  public static async handle(): Promise<void> {
    /* YOUR CODE HERE */
  }
}
```

You can pass the following parameters to the `@ScheduledCommand` decorator:



* `minute`: A cron expression to specify the minute(s) in which the command will be triggered. For example, `0/5` means "every 5 minutes". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55` to specify a list of minutes.
* `hour`: A cron expression to specify the hour(s) in which the command will be triggered. For example, `0/2` means "every 2 hours". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23` to specify a list of hours.
* `day`: A cron expression to specify the day(s) in which the command will be triggered. For example, `1/2` means "every 2 days". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31` to specify a list of days.
* `month`: A cron expression to specify the month(s) in which the command will be triggered. For example, `1/2` means "every 2 months". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `1,3,5,7,9,11` to specify a list of months.
* `weekDay`: A cron expression to specify the day(s) of the week in which the command will be triggered. For example, `1/2` means "every 2 days of the week". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `1,3,5` to specify a list of days of the week.
* `year`: A cron expression to specify the year(s) in which the command will be triggered. For example, `2020/2` means "every 2 years". You can also use a comma-separated list of values, like `2020,2022,2024,2026,2028,2030` to specify a list of years.

By default, if no paramaters are passed, the scheduled command will not be triggered.

## Creating a scheduled command

The preferred way to create a scheduled command is by using the generator, e.g.

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
boost new:scheduled-command CheckCartCount
```

</TerminalWindow>
