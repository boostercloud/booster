# Features

## Logging in Booster

If no configuration is provided, Booster uses the default JavaScript logging capabilities. Depending on the log level, it will call to `console.debug`, `console.info`, `console.warn` or `console.error`. In this regard, there's no distinction from any other node process and you'll find the logs in your cloud provider's default log aggregator (i.e. Cloudwatch if you use AWS).

### Advanced logging

If you need advanced logging capabilities such as redirecting your logs to a log aggregator, Booster also supports overriding the default behavior by providing custom loggers. The only thing you need to do is to provide an object that implements the `Logger` interface at config time:

_The Logger interface (In package `@boostercloud/framework-types`):_

```typescript
interface Logger {
  debug(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void
  info(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void
  warn(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void
  error(message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void
}
```

You can set your logger, as well as the log level and your preferred log prefix (Defaults to the string `'Booster'`) in your `config.ts` file for each of your environments:

_In your project's config.ts file:_

```typescript
Booster.configure('development', (config: BoosterConfig): void => {
  config.appName = 'my-store'
  config.providerPackage = '@boostercloud/framework-provider-aws'
  
  config.logger = new MyCustomLogger() // Overrides the default logger object
  config.logLevel = Level.debug        // Sets the log level at 'debug'     
  config.logPrefix = 'my-store-dev'    // Sets the default prefix
})
```

### Using the Booster's logger

All framework's components will use this logger by default and will generate logs that match the following pattern:

```text
[<logPrefix>]|moduleName: <message>
```

You can get a custom logger instance that extends the configured logger by adding your moduleName and optionally overriding the configured prefix with the `getLogger` helper function. It's a good practice to build and use a separate logger instance built with this method for each context, as this will make it easier to filter your logs when you need to investigate a problem.

_Example: Obtaining a logger for your command:_

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: [User],
})
export class UpdateShippingAddress {
  public constructor(readonly cartId: UUID, readonly address: Address) {}

  public static async handle(command: UpdateShippingAddress, register: Register): Promise<void> {
    const logger = getLogger(Booster.config, 'UpdateShippingCommand#handler', 'MyApp')
    logger.debug(`User ${register.currentUser?.username} changed shipping address for cart ${command.cartId}: ${JSON.stringify(command.address}`)
    register.events(new ShippingAddressUpdated(command.cartId, command.address))
  }
}

```

When a `UpdateShippingAddress` command is handled, it wil log messages that look like the following:

```text
[MyApp]|UpdateShippingCommand#handler: User buyer42 changed shipping address for cart 314: { street: '13th rue del percebe', number: 6, ... }
```

Using the configured Booster logger is not mandatory for your application, but it might be convenient to centralize your logs and this is a standard way to do it.

## Authentication and Authorization

Booster accepts standard [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/) to authenticate incoming requests. Likewise, you can use the claims included in these tokens to authorize access to commands or read models by using the provided simple role-based authorization or writing your own authorizer functions.

:::note
To learn how to include the access token in your requests, check the section [Authorizing operations](#authorizing-operations).
:::

### Validating incoming tokens (Authentication)

In order to validate incoming tokens and make sure that user requests come from trustable origins, you need to provide one or more `TokenVerifier` instances at config time for each of your environments. Booster provides standard implementations for jwskUri and public key based authentication:

```typescript
import { Booster } from '@boostercloud/framework-core'
import { BoosterConfig } from '@boostercloud/framework-types'

Booster.configure('production', (config: BoosterConfig): void => {
  config.appName = 'demoapp'
  config.providerPackage = '@boostercloud/framework-provider-aws'
  config.tokenVerifiers = [
    new JwskUriTokenVerifier(
      'https://securetoken.google.com/demoapp',
      'https://demoapp.firebase.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
      'firebase:groups'
    ),
    new PublicKeyTokenVerifier(
      'custom-key-pair',
      getCustomKey(),
      'custom:roles'
    ),
  ]
})
```

#### JWKS URI based authorization

One common way to validate JWT tokens is by using a issuer-provided well-known URI on which you can find their [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) sets (JWKS). If you use this method, you only need to provide the issuer's name, the JWKS URI and, if you're using role-based authentication, an optional `rolesClaim` option that sets the claim from which Booster will read the role names.

```typescript
...
config.tokenVerifiers = [
  new JwskUriTokenVerifier(
    'https://securetoken.google.com/demoapp', // Issuer name
    'https://demoapp.firebase.com/.well-known/jwks.json', // JWKS URI that points to the issuer's well-known JWKS JSON file
    'firebase:groups', // Name of the claim to read the roles from (when you're using role-based authorization)
  ),
]
...
```

#### Public key based authentication

If the token issuer doesn't provide a JWKS URI, you can also validate tokens against a known public key. One scenario where this is useful is when you're implementing your own authentication mechanism or you're issuing self-signed tokens.

:::note
If you need to handle private keys in production, consider using a KMS [(Key Management System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management#Key_storage)). These systems often provide API endpoints that let you encrypt/sign your JWT tokens without exposing the private keys. The public keys can be set in a `PublicKeyTokenVerifier` to automate verification.
:::

```typescript
config.tokenVerifiers = [
  new PublicKeyTokenVerifier(
    'custom-key-pair', // Issuer name
    getCustomKey(), // Promise that resolves to the public key string
    'custom:roles', // Name of the claim to read the roles from (when you're using role-based authorization)
  ),
]
```

Notice that the `publicKeyResolver` is a promise that resolves to a string, so it can be used to load the public key from a remote location too (i.e. get it from your KMS).

#### Custom authentication

You can also provide your own `TokenVerifier` implementation for advanced acceptance criteria beyond simple cryptographic signature checks. An use case for this could be to check that the token was generated specifically for your service by inspecting the `aud` claim, or check that the token has not been blacklisted or invalidated by your business logic (i.e. a user logs out before the token's expiration date and is included in an invalidated tokens list to make sure that an attacker that finds the token later can't use it to impersonate the legitimate owner).

Booster will accept as a token verifier any object that matches the `TokenVerifier` interface:

```typescript
export interface TokenVerifier {
  // Verify and deserialize a stringified token with this token verifier.
  verify(token: string): Promise<DecodedToken>
  // Build a valid `UserEnvelope` from a decoded token.
  toUserEnvelope(decodedToken: DecodedToken): UserEnvelope
}
```

If you only need to perform extra validations on top of one of the default `TokenVerifier`s, you can extend one of the default implementations:

```typescript
export class CustomValidator extends PrivateKeyValidator {
  public async verify(token: string): Promise<UserEnvelope> {
    // Call to the PrivateKeyValidator verify method to check the signature
    const userEnvelope = await super.verify(token)

    // Do my extra validations here. Throwing an error will reject the token
    await myExtraValidations(userEnvelope.claims, token)

    return userEnvelope
  }
}
```

If you need to do more advanced checks, you can implement the whole verification algorithm yourself (this could make sense if you're using non-standard or legacy tokens). Booster exposes for convenience many of the utility functions that it uses in the default `TokenVerifier` implementations:

```typescript
/**
 * Initializes a jwksRSA client that can be used to get the public key of a JWKS URI using the
 * `getKeyWithClient` function.
 */
export function getJwksClient(jwksUri: string) {
  ...
}

/**
 * Initializes a function that can be used to get the public key from a JWKS URI with the signature
 * required by the `verifyJWT` function. You can create a client using the `getJwksClient` function.
 */
export function getKeyWithClient(
  client: jwksRSA.JwksClient,
  header: jwt.JwtHeader,
  callback: jwt.SigningKeyCallback
): void {
  ...
}

/**
 * Verifies a JWT token using a key or key resolver function and returns a Booster UserEnvelope.
 */
export async function verifyJWT(
  token: string,
  issuer: string,
  key: jwt.Secret | jwt.GetPublicKeyOrSecret,
  rolesClaim?: string
): Promise<UserEnvelope> {
 ...
}
```

### Checking when a valid user can perform a specific actions (Authentication)

Every Command and ReadModel in Booster has an `authorize` policy that tells Booster who can access it. Booster authorization follows a whitelisting approach, so all read models and commands are inaccessible by default unless you define a different behavior. The `authorize` parameter accepts one of the following options:

- `'all'`: The command or read-model is explicitly public: any user, both authenticated and anonymous, can access it.
- An array of authorized roles `[Role1, Role2, ...]`: This means that only those authenticated users that
  have any of the roles listed there are authorized to execute the command.
- An authorizer function that matches the `CommandAuthorizer` interface for commands or the `ReadModelAuthorizer` interface for read models.

#### `authorize: 'all'`: Making commands and read models public

Setting the option `authorize: all` in a command or read model will make it publicly accessible to anyone that has access to the graphql endpoint. For example, the following command can be executed by anyone, even if they don't provide a valid JWT token:

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: 'all',
})
export class CreateComment {
  ...
}
```

:::note
**Think twice if you really need fully open GraphQL endpoints in your application**, this might be useful during development, but we recommend to **avoid exposing your endpoints in this way in production**. Even for public APIs, it might be useful to issue API keys to avoid abuse. Booster is designed to scale to any given demand, but scaling also increases the cloud bill! (See [Denial of wallet attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221421262100079X))
:::

#### Simple Role-based authorization

Booster provides a simple role-based authentication mechanism that will work in many standard scenarios. As many other Booster artifacts, Roles are defined as simple decorated classes, typically in (but not limited to) the `src/config/roles.ts` file. To define a role, you only need to decorate an empty class with the `@Role` decorator as follows:

```typescript
@Role()
export class User {}

@Role()
export class Admin {}
```

Once they're defined you can set them in any command or read model `authorize` policy. For instance, the following command can be executed by authenticated users that have the role `Admin` or `User` and will reject any request from users that don't have valid JWT tokens or have valid tokens but doesn't have one of the roles' names in their token (Remember that the name of the claim from which Booster reads the roles from can be configured in the `roleClaims` option in the corresponding `TokenVerifier`):

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: [Admin, User],
})
export class UpdateUser {
  ...
}
```

Remember to also configure your JWT tokens issuer to include the custom claims required in your Booster app (If you're not using the provider default one). For instance, for the previous `UpdateUser` command, Booster will expect to receive a token that includes a claim matching the one defined in the `TokenVerifier`'s `rolesClaim` property with the value `Admin` or `User`. Here is an example from a Firebase token:

```json
{
  "firebase:groups": "User", // <- roles are read from 'firebase:groups' claim
  "iss": "https://securetoken.google.com/demoapp",
  "aud": "demoapp",
  "auth_time": 1604676721,
  "user_id": "xJY5Y6fTbVggNtDjaNh7cNSBd7q1",
  "sub": "xJY5Y6fTbVggNtDjaNh7cNSBd7q1",
  "iat": 1604676721,
  "exp": 1604680321,
  "phone_number": "+999999999",
  "firebase": {}
}
```

##### Extended roles when using the [Authentication Booster Rocket for AWS](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure)

The Authentication Rocket for AWS is an opinionated implementation of a JWT tokens issuer on top of AWS Cognito that includes out-of-the-box features like sign-up, sign-in, passwordless tokens, change password and many other features. When a user goes through the sign up and sign in mecanisms provided by the rocket, they'll get a standard JWT access token that can be included in any request as a Bearer token and will work in the same way as any other JWT token.

When you use this rocket, you can use extra configuration parameters in the `@Role` decorator to enable some of these features. In the following example we define `Admin`, `User`, `SuperUser` and `SuperUserWithoutConfirmation` roles. They all contain an extra `auth` configuration attribute that set the behavior of the authorization role for each role:

```typescript
@Role({
  auth: {
    signUpMethods: [], // Using an empty array here prevents sign-ups (Admin has no special treatment. If you don't enable signup, you'll need to create the first admin manually in the AWS console)
  },
})
export class Admin {}

@Role({
  auth: {
    signUpMethods: ['email'], // Enable email sign-ups for Users
  },
})
export class User {}

@Role({
  auth: {
    signUpMethods: ['email', 'phone'], // Can sign up by email or phone
    skipConfirmation: false, // It requires email or phone confirmation. The rocket will send either an email or a SMS with a confirmation link.
  },
})
export class SuperUser {}

@Role({
  auth: {
    signUpMethods: ['email', 'phone'],
    skipConfirmation: true, // It doesn't require email or phone confirmation
  },
})
export class SuperUserWithoutConfirmation {}
```

To learn more about the Authorization rocket for AWS, please read the [README](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure/blob/main/README.md) in its Github repository.

### Accessing the event streams API

You can enable access (disabled by default) to one or more entities' events streams through the events API. To do so, you just need to add a configuration object setting the `authorizeReadEvents` policy with any of the supported authorization mechanisms (`'all'` to make them public, an array of roles, or an authorizer function that matches the `EventStreamAuthorizer` type signature). For example:

```typescript
@Entity({
  authorizeReadEvents: 'all', // Anyone can read any Cart's event
})
export class Cart {
  public constructor(
    readonly id: UUID,
    readonly cartItems: Array<CartItem>,
    public shippingAddress?: Address,
    public checks = 0
  ) {}
  // <reducers...>
}
```

:::note
Be careful when exposing events data, as this data is likely to hold internal system state. Pay special attention when authorizing public access with the `'all'` option, it's always recommended to look for alternate solutions that limit access.
:::

#### Custom authorization with authorizer functions

If the role-based authorization model doesn't work for your application (for instance, when your application requires permission-based authorization), you can implement your own authorization mechanisms by providing authorizer functions to commands, read models or entities (to access event streams). As authorizers are regular JavaScript functions, you can easily reuse them in your project or even in other Booster projects as a library.

##### Command Authorizers

Command authorizers are functions that match the `CommandAuthorizer` type:

```typescript
export type CommandAuthorizer = (currentUser?: UserEnvelope, input?: CommandInput) => Promise<void>
```

For instance, if you want to restrict a command to users that have a permission named `Permission-To-Rock` in the `permissions` claim you can do this:

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: async (currentUser) => {
    if (!currentUser.claims['permissions'].includes('Permission-To-Rock')) {
      throw new Error(`User ${currentUser.username} should not be rocking!`)
    }
  }
})
export class PerformIncredibleGuitarSolo {
  ...
}
```

##### Read Model Authorizers

Read Model Authorizers are functions that match the `ReadModelAuthorizer` type:

```typescript
export type ReadModelAuthorizer<TReadModel extends ReadModelInterface> = (
  currentUser?: UserEnvelope,
  readModelRequestEnvelope?: ReadModelRequestEnvelope<TReadModel>
) => Promise<void>
```

For instance, you may want to restrict access to a specific resource only to people that has been granted read permission:

```typescript
@ReadModel({
  authorize: async (currentUser, readModelRequestEnvelope) => {
    const userPermissions = Booster.entity(UserPermissions, currentUser.username)
    if (!userPermissions || !userPermissions.accessTo[readModelRequestEnvelope.className].includes(readModelRequestEnvelope.key.id)) {
      throw new Error(`User ${currentUser.username} should not be looking here`)
    }
  }
})
```

##### Event Stream Authorizers

Event Stream Authorizers are functions that match the `EventStreamAuthorizer` type:

```typescript
export type EventStreamAuthorizer = (
  currentUser?: UserEnvelope,
  eventSearchRequest?: EventSearchRequest
) => Promise<void>
```

For instance, you can restrict access to entities that the current user own.

```typescript
@Entity({
  authorizeReadEvents: (currentUser, eventSearchRequest) => {
    const { entityID } = eventSearchRequest.parameters
    if (!entityID) {
      throw new Error(`${currentUser.username} cannot list carts`)
    }
    const cart = Booster.entity(Cart, entityID)
    if (cart.ownerUserName !== currentUser.userName) {
      throw new Error(`${currentUser.username} cannot see events in cart ${entityID}`)
    }
  }
})
export class Cart {
  public constructor(
    readonly id: UUID,
    readonly ownerUserName: string,
    readonly cartItems: Array<CartItem>,
    public shippingAddress?: Address,
    public checks = 0
  ) {}
  ...
}
```

## GraphQL API

This is the main API of your application, as it allows you to:

- _Modify_ data by **sending commands**.
- _Read_ data by **querying read models**.
- _Receive data in real time_ by **subscribing to read models**.

All this is done through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a query language for APIs that has useful advantages over simple REST APIs.

If you are not familiar with GraphQL, then, first of all, don't worry!
_Using_ a GraphQL API is simple and straightforward.
_Implementing it_ on the server side is usually the hard part, as you need to define your schema, operations, resolvers, etc.
Luckily, you can forget about that because Booster does all the work for you!

The GraphQL API is fully **auto-generated** based on your _commands_ and _read models_.

:::note
To get the full potential of the GraphQL API,  it is **not** recommended to use `interface` types in any command or read model attributes. Use `class` types instead. This will allow you to perform complex graphQL filters, including over nested attributes. There's an example below:
:::

```typescript
// My type
export class ItemWithQuantity {
  // Use "class", not "interface"
  public constructor(sku: string, quantity: number) {}
}
```

```typescript
// The read-model file
import { ItemWithQuantity } from "./types";
@ReadModel({
  authorize: 'all'
})
export class CartReadModel {
  public constructor(
          readonly id: UUID,
          item: ItemWithQuantity // As ItemWithQuantity is a class, you will be able to query over nested attributes like item `quantity`
  ) {}
```

### Relationship between GraphQL operations and commands and read models

GraphQL defines three kinds of operations that you can use: _mutations_, _queries_, and _subscriptions_.

The names are pretty meaningful, but we can say that you use a `mutation` when you want to change data, a `query` when you want to get
data on-demand, and a `subscription` when you want to receive data at the moment it is updated.

Knowing this, you can infer the relationship between those operations and your Booster components:

- You _send_ a **command** using a **mutation**.
- You _read_ a **read model** using a **query**.
- You _subscribe_ to a **read model** using a **subscription**.

### How to send GraphQL request

GraphQL uses two existing protocols:

- _HTTP_ for `mutation` and `query` operations.
- _WebSocket_ for `subscription` operations.

The reason for the WebSocket protocol is that, in order for subscriptions to work, there must be a way for the server to send data to clients when it is changed. HTTP doesn't allow that, as it is the client the one which always initiates the request.

So you should use the **graphqlURL** to send GraphQL queries and mutations, and the **websocketURL** to send subscriptions. You can see both URLs after deploying your application.

Therefore:

- To send a GraphQL mutation/query, you send an HTTP request to _"&lt;graphqlURL&gt;"_, with _method POST_, and a _JSON-encoded body_ with the mutation/query details.
- To send a GraphQL subscription, you first connect to the _"&lt;websocketURL&gt;"_, and then send a _JSON-encoded message_ with the subscription details, _following [the "GraphQL over WebSocket" protocol](#the-graphql-over-websocket-protocol)_.

:::note
You can also **send queries and mutations through the WebSocket** if that's convenient to you. See ["The GraphQL over WebSocket protocol"](#the-graphql-over-websocket-protocol) to know more.
:::

While it is OK to know how to manually send GraphQL request, you normally don't need to deal with this low-level details, especially with the WebSocket stuff.

To have a great developer experience, we **strongly recommend** to use a GraphQL client for your platform of choice. Here are some great ones:

- **[Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)**: Ideal for testing sending manual requests, getting the schema, etc.
- **Apollo clients**: These are the "go-to" SDKs to interact with a GraphQL API from your clients. It is very likely that there is a version for your client programming language. Check the ["Using Apollo Client"](#using-apollo-client) section to know more about this.

### Get GraphQL schema from deployed application

After deploying your application with the command `boost deploy -e development`, you can get your GraphQL schema by using a tool like **[Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)**. The previous command displays multiple endpoints, one of them is **graphqlURL**, which has the following pattern:

`https://<base_url>/<environment>/graphql`

By entering this URL in Altair, the schema can be displayed as shown in the screenshot (You need to click on the Docs button in the URL bar). You can
check the available Queries and Mutations by clicking on their name:

![Altair queries](/img/altair-queries.png)
![Altair mutations](/img/altair-mutations.png)

### Sending commands

As mentioned in the previous section, we need to use a "mutation" to send a command. The structure of a mutation (the body of the request) is the following:

```graphql
mutation {
  command_name(input: {
    input_field_list
  })
}
```

Where:

- _**command_name**_ is the name of the class corresponding to the command you want to send
- _**input_field_list**_ is a list of pairs in the form of `fieldName: fieldValue` containing the data of your command. The field names correspond to the names of the properties you defined in the command class.

In the following example we send a command named "ChangeCart" that will add/remove an item to/from a shopping cart. The command requires the ID of the cart (`cartId`), the item identifier (`sku`) and the quantity of units we are adding/removing (`quantity`).

```text
URL: "<graphqlURL>"
```

```graphql
mutation {
  ChangeCart(input: { cartId: "demo", sku: "ABC_01", quantity: 2 })
}
```

In case we are not using any GraphQL client, this would be the equivalent bare HTTP request:

```text
URL: "<graphqlURL>"
METHOD: "POST"
```

```json
{
  "query": "mutation { ChangeCart(input: { cartId: \"demo\" sku: \"ABC_01\" quantity: 2 }) }"
}
```

And this would be the response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "ChangeCart": true
  }
}
```

:::note
Remember to set the proper **access token** for secured commands, check ["Authorizing operations"](#authorizing-operations).
:::

### Reading read models

To read a specific read model, we need to use a "query" operation. The structure of the "query" (the body
of the request) is the following:

```graphql
query {
  read_model_name(id: "<id of the read model>") {
    selection_field_list
  }
}
```

Where:

- _read_model_name_ is the name of the class corresponding to the read model you want to retrieve.
- _&lt;id of the read model&gt;_ is the ID of the specific read model instance you are interested in.
- _selection_field_list_ is a list with the names of the specific read model fields you want to get as response.

In the following example we send a query to read a read model named `CartReadModel` whose ID is `demo`. We get back its `id` and the list of cart `items` as response.

```text
URL: "<graphqlURL>"
```

```graphql
query {
  CartReadModel(id: "demo") {
    id
    items
  }
}
```

In case we are not using any GraphQL client, this would be the equivalent bare HTTP request:

```text
URL: "<graphqlURL>"
METHOD: "POST"
```

```json
{
  "query": "query { CartReadModel(id: \"demo\") { id items } }"
}
```

And we would get the following as response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "CartReadModel": {
      "id": "demo",
      "items": [
        {
          "sku": "ABC_01",
          "quantity": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Remember to set the proper **access token** for secured read models, check ["Authorizing operations"](#authorizing-operations).
:::

### Subscribing to read models

To subscribe to a specific read model, we need to use a subscription operation, and it must be _sent through the **websocketURL**_ using the [_GraphQL over WebSocket_ protocol](#the-graphql-over-websocket-protocol).

Doing this process manually is a bit cumbersome. _You will probably never need to do this_, as GraphQL clients like [Apollo](#using-apollo-client) abstract this process away. However, we will explain how to do it for learning purposes.

Before sending any subscription, you need to _connect_ to the WebSocket to open the two-way communication channel. This connection is done differently depending on the client/library you use to manage web sockets. In this section, we will show examples using the [`wscat`](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) command line program. You can also use the online tool [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)

Once you have connected successfully, you can use this channel to:

- Send the subscription messages.
- Listen for messages sent by the server with data corresponding to your active subscriptions.

The structure of the "subscription" (the body of the message) is exactly the same as the "query" operation:

```graphql
subscription {
  read_model_name(id: "<id of the read model>") {
    selection_field_list
  }
}
```

Where:

- _read_model_name_ is the name of the class corresponding to the read model you want to subscribe to.
- _&lt;id of the read model&gt;_ is the ID of the specific read model instance you are interested in.
- _selection_field_list_ is a list with the names of the specific read model fields you want to get when data is sent back to you.

In the following examples we use [`wscat`](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) to connect to the web socket. After that, we send the required messages to conform the [_GraphQL over WebSocket_ protocol](#the-graphql-over-websocket-protocol), including the subscription operation to the read model `CartReadModel` with ID `demo`.

1. Connect to the web socket:

```sh
 wscat -c <websocketURL> -s graphql-ws
```

:::note
You should specify the `graphql-ws` subprotocol when connecting with your client via the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header (in this case, `wscat` does that when you use the `-s` option).
:::

Now we can start sending messages just by writing them and hitting the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

2. Initiate the protocol connection :

```json
{ "type": "connection_init" }
```

In case you want to authorize the connection, you need to send the authorization token in the `payload.Authorization` field:

```json
{ "type": "connection_init", "payload": { "Authorization": "<your token>" } }
```

3. Send a message with the subscription. We need to provide an ID for the operation. When the server sends us data back, it will include this same ID so that we know which subscription the received data belongs to (again, this is just for learning, [GraphQL clients](#using-apollo-client) manages this for you)

```json
{ "id": "1", "type": "start", "payload": { "query": "subscription { CartReadModel(id:\"demo\") { id items } }" } }
```

After a successful subscription, you won't receive anything in return. Now, every time the read model you subscribed to is modified, a new incoming message will appear in the socket with the updated version of the read model. This message will have exactly the same format as if you were done a query with the same parameters.

Following with the previous example, we now send a command (using a mutation operation) that adds a new item with sku "ABC_02" to the `CartReadModel`. After it has been added, we receive the updated version of the read model through the socket.

1. Send the following command (this time using an HTTP request):

```
URL: "<graphqlURL>"
```

```graphql
mutation {
  ChangeCart(input: { cartId: "demo", sku: "ABC_02", quantity: 3 })
}
```

2. The following message (after formatting it) appears through the socket connection we had opened:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "type": "data",
  "payload": {
    "data": {
      "CartReadModel": {
        "id": "demo",
        "items": [
          {
            "sku": "ABC_01",
            "quantity": 2
          },
          {
            "sku": "ABC_02",
            "quantity": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Remember that, in case you want to subscribe to a read model that is restricted to a specific set of roles, you must send the **access token** retrieved upon sign-in. Check ["Authorizing operations"](#authorizing-operations) to know how to do this.

### Adding before hooks to your read models

When you send queries or subscriptions to your read models, you can tell Booster to execute some code before executing the operation. These are called `before` hooks, and they receive a `ReadModelRequestEnvelope` object representing the current request.

```typescript
interface ReadModelRequestEnvelope<TReadModel> {
  currentUser?: UserEnvelope // The current authenticated user
  requestID: UUID // An ID assigned to this request
  key?: { // If present, contains the id and sequenceKey that identify a specific read model
    id: UUID
    sequenceKey?: SequenceKey
  }
  className: string // The read model class name
  filters: ReadModelRequestProperties<TReadModel> // Filters set in the GraphQL query
  limit?: number // Query limit if set
  afterCursor?: unknown // For paginated requests, id to start reading from
}
```

In before hooks, you can either abort the request or alter and return the request object to change the behavior of your request. Before hooks are useful for many use cases, but they're especially useful to add fine-grained access control. For example, to enforce a filter that restrict a logged in user to access only read models objects they own.

When a `before` hook throws an exception, the request is aborted and the error is sent back to the user. In order to continue with the request, it's required that the request object is returned.

In order to define a before hook you pass a list of functions with the right signature to the read model decorator `before` parameter:

```typescript
@ReadModel({
  authorize: [User],
  before: [validateUser],
})
export class CartReadModel {
  public constructor(
    readonly id: UUID,
    readonly userId: UUID
  ) {}
  // Your projections go here
}

function validateUser(request: ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel>): ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel> {
  if (request.filters?.userId?.eq !== request.currentUser?.id) throw NotAuthorizedError("...")
  return request
}
```

You can also define more than one `before` hook for a read model, and they will be chained, sending the resulting request object from a hook to the next one.

:::note
The order in which filters are specified matters.
:::

```typescript
import { changeFilters } from '../../filters-helper' // You can also use external functions!

@ReadModel({
  authorize: [User],
  before: [validateUser, validateEmail, changeFilters],
})
export class CartReadModel {
  public constructor(
    readonly id: UUID,
    readonly userId: UUID
  ) {}

  // Your projections go here
}

function validateUser(request: ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel>): ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel> {
  if (request.filters?.userId?.eq !== request.currentUser?.id) throw NotAuthorizedError("...")
  return request
}

function validateEmail(request: ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel>): ReadModelRequestEnvelope<CartReadModel> {
  if (!request.filters.email.includes('myCompanyDomain.com')) throw NotAuthorizedError("...")
  return request
}
```

### Adding before hooks to your commands

You can use `before` hooks also in your command handlers, and [they work as the Read Models ones](#Adding-before-hooks-to-your-read-models), with a slight difference: **we don't modify `filters` but `inputs` (the parameters sent with a command)**. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same, here's an example:

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: [User],
  before: [beforeFn],
})
export class ChangeCartItem {
  public constructor(readonly cartId: UUID, readonly productId: UUID, readonly quantity: number) {
  }
}

function beforeFn(input: CommandInput, currentUser?: UserEnvelope): CommandInput {
  if (input.cartUserId !== currentUser.id) {
    throw NonAuthorizedUserException() // We don't let this user to trigger the command
  }
  return input
}
```

As you can see, we just check if the `cartUserId` is equal to the `currentUser.id`, which is the user id extracted from the auth token. This way, we can throw an exception and avoid this user to call this command.

### Reading events

You can also fetch events directly if you need. To do so, there are two kind of queries that have the following structure:

```graphql
query {
  eventsByEntity(entity: <name of entity>, entityID: "<id of the entity>") {
    selection_field_list
  }
}

query {
  eventsByType(type: <name of event>) {
    selection_field_list
  }
}
```

Where:

- _&lt;name of your entity&gt;_ is the name of the class corresponding to the entity whose events you want to retrieve.
- _&lt;id of the entity&gt;_ is the ID of the specific entity instance whose events you are interested in. **This is optional**
- _&lt;name of event&gt;_ is the name of the class corresponding to the event type whose instances you want to retrieve.
- _selection_field_list_ is a list with the names of the specific fields you want to get as response. See the response example below to know more.

#### Examples

```text
  URL: "<graphqlURL>"
```

**A) Read all events associated with a specific instance (a specific ID) of the entity Cart**

```graphql
query {
  eventsByEntity(entity: Cart, entityID: "ABC123") {
    type
    entity
    entityID
    requestID
    createdAt
    value
  }
}
```

**B) Read all events associated with any instance of the entity Cart**

```graphql
query {
  eventsByEntity(entity: Cart) {
    type
    entity
    entityID
    requestID
    createdAt
    value
  }
}
```

For these cases, you would get an array of event _envelopes_ as a response. This means that you get some metadata related to the event along with the event content, which can be found inside the `"value"` field.

The response look like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "eventsByEntity": [
      {
        "type": "CartItemChanged",
        "entity": "Cart",
        "entityID": "ABC123",
        "requestID": "7a9cc6a7-7c7f-4ef0-aef1-b226ae4d94fa",
        "createdAt": "2021-05-12T08:41:13.792Z",
        "value": {
          "productId": "73f7818c-f83e-4482-be49-339c004b6fdf",
          "cartId": "ABC123",
          "quantity": 2
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**C) Read events of a specific type**

```graphql
query {
  eventsByType(type: CartItemChanged) {
    type
    entity
    entityID
    requestID
    createdAt
    value
  }
}
```

The response would have the same structure as seen in the previous examples. The only difference is that this time you will get only the events with the type you have specified ("CartItemChanged")

#### Time filters

Optionally, for any of the previous queries, you can include a `from` and/or `to` time filters to get only those events that happened inside that time range. You must use a string with a time in ISO format with any precision you like, for example:

- `from:"2021"` : Events created on 2021 year or up.
- `from:"2021-02-12" to:"2021-02-13"` : Events created during February 12th.
- `from:"2021-03-16T16:16:25.178"` : Events created at that date and time, using millisecond precision, or later.

#### Time filters examples

**A) Cart events from February 23rd to July 20th, 2021**

```graphql
query {
  eventsByEntity(entity: Cart, from: "2021-02-23", to: "2021-07-20") {
    type
    entity
    entityID
    requestID
    createdAt
    value
  }
}
```

**B) CartItemChanged events from February 25th to February 28th, 2021**

```graphql
query {
  eventsByType(type: CartItemChanged, from: "2021-02-25", to: "2021-02-28") {
    type
    entity
    entityID
    requestID
    createdAt
    value
  }
}
```

#### Known limitations

- Subscriptions don't work for the events API yet
- You can only query events, but not write them through this API. Use a command for that.
- Currently, only available on the AWS provider.

### Filter & Pagination

#### Filtering a read model

The Booster GraphQL API provides support for filtering Read Models on `queries` and `subscriptions`.

Using the GraphQL API endpoint you can retrieve the schema of your application so you can see what are the filters for every Read Model and its properties. You can filter like this:

Searching for a specific Read Model by `id`

```graphql
query {
  ProductReadModels(filter: { id: { eq: "test-id" } }) {
    id
    sku
    availability
    price
  }
}
```

#### Supported filters

The currently supported filters are the following ones:

##### Boolean filters

| Filter |   Value    |  Description |
| :----- | :--------: | -----------: |
| eq     | true/false |     Equal to |
| ne     | true/false | Not equal to |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  ProductReadModels(filter: { availability: { eq: true } }) {
    id
    sku
    availability
    price
  }
}
```

##### Number filters

| Filter |  Value  |           Description |
| :----- | :-----: | --------------------: |
| eq     |  Float  |              Equal to |
| ne     |  Float  |          Not equal to |
| gt     |  Float  |          Greater than |
| gte    |  Float  | Greater or equal than |
| lt     |  Float  |            Lower than |
| lte    |  Float  |   Lower or equal than |
| in     | [Float] | Exists in given array |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  ProductReadModels(filter: { price: { gt: 200 } }) {
    id
    sku
    availability
    price
  }
}
```

##### String filters

| Filter     |  Value   |                Description |
| :--------- | :------: | -------------------------: |
| eq         |  String  |                   Equal to |
| ne         |  String  |               Not equal to |
| gt         |  String  |               Greater than |
| gte        |  String  |      Greater or equal than |
| lt         |  String  |                 Lower than |
| lte        |  String  |        Lower or equal than |
| in         | [String] |      Exists in given array |
| beginsWith |  String  | Starts with a given substr |
| contains   |  String  |    Contains a given substr |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  ProductReadModels(filter: { sku: { begingsWith: "jewelry" } }) {
    id
    sku
    availability
    price
  }
}
```

:::note
`eq` and `ne` are valid filters for checking if a field value is null or not null.
:::

##### Array filters

| Filter   | Value  |             Description |
| :------- | :----: | ----------------------: |
| includes | Object | Includes a given object |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  CartReadModels(filter: { itemsIds: { includes: "test-item" } }) {
    id
    price
    itemsIds
  }
}
```

:::note
Right now, with complex properties in Arrays, you just can filter them if you know the exact value of an element but is not possible to filter from a property of the element. As a workaround, you can use an array of ids of the complex property and filter for that property as in the example above.
:::

##### Filter combinators

All the filters can be combined to create a more complex search on the same properties of the ReadModel.

| Filter |     Value     |                                      Description |
| :----- | :-----------: | -----------------------------------------------: |
| and    |   [Filters]   |       AND - all filters on the list have a match |
| or     |   [Filters]   | OR - At least one filter of the list has a match |
| not    | Filter/and/or |            The element does not match the filter |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  CartReadModels(filter: { or: [{ id: { contains: "a" } }, { id: { contains: "b" } }] }) {
    id
    price
    itemsIds
  }
}
```

##### IsDefined operator

| Filter    |    Value    |         Description |
|:----------|:-----------:|--------------------:|
| isDefined | true/false  | field exists or not |

Example:

```graphql
query {
  CartReadModels(filter: { price: { isDefined: true } }) {
    id
    price
    itemsIds
  }
}
```

#### Getting and filtering read models data at code level

Booster allows you to get your read models data in your commands handlers and event handlers using the `Booster.readModel` method.

For example, you can filter and get the total number of the products that meet your criteria in your commands like this:

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: 'all',
})
export class GetProductsCount {
  public constructor(readonly filters: Record<string, any>) {}

  public static async handle(): Promise<void> {
    const searcher = Booster.readModel(ProductReadModel)

    searcher.filter({
      sku: { contains: 'toy' },
      or: [
        {
          description: { contains: 'fancy' },
        },
        {
          description: { contains: 'great' },
        },
      ],
    })

    const result = await searcher.search()
    return { count: result.length }
  }
}
```

> **Warning**: Notice that `ReadModel`s are eventually consistent objects that are calculated as all events in all entities that affect the read model are settled. You should not assume that a read model is a proper source of truth, so you shouldn't use this feature for data validations. If you need to query the most up-to-date current state, consider fetching your Entities, instead of ReadModels, with `Booster.entity`

#### Using sorting

Booster allows you to sort your read models data in your commands handlers and event handlers using the `Booster.readModel` method.

For example, you can sort and get the products in your commands like this:

```graphql
{
  ListCartReadModels(filter: {}, limit: 5, sortBy: {
    shippingAddress: {
      firstName: ASC
    }
  }) {
    items {
      id
      cartItems 
      checks
      shippingAddress {
        firstName
      }
      payment {
        cartId
      }
      cartItemsIds
    }
    cursor
  }
}
```

This is a preview feature available only for some Providers and with some limitations:

- Azure:
  - Sort by one field supported.
  - Nested fields supported.
  - Sort by more than one file: **unsupported**.
- Local:
  - Sort by one field supported.
  - Nested fields supported.
  - Sort by more than one file: **unsupported**.

> **Warning**: It is not possible to sort by fields defined as Interface, only classes or primitives types.

#### Using pagination

The Booster GraphQL API includes a type for your read models that stands for `List{"your-read-model-name"}`, which is the official way to work with pagination. Alternative, there is another type without the `List` prefix, which will be deprecated in future versions.

The Read Model List type includes some new parameters that can be used on queries:

- `limit`; an integer that specifies the maximum number of items to be returned.
- `afterCursor`; a parameter to set the `cursor` property returned by the previous query, if not null.

 Example:

```graphql
query {
  ListProductReadModels
  (
    limit: 1,
    afterCursor: { id: "last-page-item"}
  ) {
    id
    sku
    availability
    price
  }
}
```

Besides the parameters, this type also returns a type `{your-read-model-name}Connection`, it includes the following properties:

- `cursor`; if there are more results to paginate, it will return the object to pass to the `afterCursor` parameter on the next query. If there aren't more items to be shown, it will be undefined.
- `items`; the list of items returned by the query, if there aren't any, it will be an empty list.

### Using Apollo Client

One of the best clients to connect to a GraphQL API is the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) client. There will probably be a version for your client technology of choice. These are the main ones:

- [For Javascript/Typescript](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) ([Github](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client))
- [For iOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/) ([Github)](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios))
- [For Java/Kotlin/Android](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/) ([Github](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android))

We recommend referring to the documentation of those clients to know how to use them. Here is an example of how to fully instantiate the Javascript client so that it works for queries, mutations and subscriptions:

```typescript
import { split, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client'
import { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities'
import { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws'
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client'
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws'

// Helper function that checks if a GraphQL operation is a subscription or not
function isSubscriptionOperation({ query }) {
  const definition = getMainDefinition(query)
  return definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' && definition.operation === 'subscription'
}

// Create an HTTP link for sending queries and mutations
const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: '<graphqlURL>',
})

// Create a SusbscriptionClient and a WebSocket link for sending subscriptions
const subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient('<websocketURL>', {
  reconnect: true,
})
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink(subscriptionClient)

// Combine both links so that depending on the operation, it uses one or another
const splitLink = split(isSubscriptionOperation, wsLink, httpLink)

// Finally, create the client using the link created above
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: splitLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})
```

Now, we can send queries, mutations and subscriptions using the `client` instance:

```typescript
import gql from 'graphql-tag'

// Query the CartReadModel
const readModelData = await client.query({
  variables: {
    cartID: 'demo',
  },
  query: gql`
    query QueryCart($cartID: ID!) {
      CartReadModel(id: $cartID) {
        id
        items
      }
    }
  `,
})

// Send a command (mutation)
const commandResult = await client.mutate({
  variables: {
    cartID: 'demo',
    sku: 'ABC_02',
  },
  mutation: gql`
    mutation AddOneItemToCart($cartID: ID!, $sku: string!) {
      ChangeCart(input: { cartId: $cartID, sku: $sku, quantity: 1 })
    }
  `,
})

// Subscribe to changes in the CartReadModel
const subscriptionOperation = client.subscribe({
  variables: {
    cartID: 'demo',
  },
  query: gql`
    subscription SubscribeToCart($cartID: ID!) {
      CartReadModel(id: $cartID) {
        id
        cartItems
      }
    }
  `,
})

subscriptionOperation.subscribe({
  next: (cartReadModel) => {
    // This function is called everytime the CartReadModel with ID="demo" is changed
    // Parameter "cartReadModel" contains the latest version of the cart
  },
})
```

### Authorizing operations

When you have a command or read model whose access is authorized to users with a specific set of roles (see [Authentication and Authorization](#authentication-and-authorization)), you need to use an authorization token to send queries, mutations or subscriptions to that command or read model.

You can use Authentication Rocket to authorize operations, see its [documentation](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure) and, more especifically, the [Sign in](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure#sign-in) section to know how to get a token. Once you have a token, the way to send it varies depending on the protocol you are using to send GraphQL operations:

- For **HTTP**, you need to send the HTTP header `Authorization` with the token, making sure you prefix it with `Bearer` (the kind of token Booster uses). For example:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
```

- For **WebSocket**, you need to adhere to the [GraphQL over WebSocket protocol](#the-graphql-over-websocket-protocol) to send authorization data. The way to do that is by sending the token in the payload of the first message you send when initializing the connection (see [Subscribing to read models](#subscribing-to-read-models)). For example:

```json
{ "type": "connection_init", "payload": { "Authorization": "<your token>" } }
```

You normally won't be sending tokens in such a low-level way. GraphQL clients have easier ways to send these tokens. See [Sending tokens with Apollo client](#sending-tokens-with-apollo-clients)

#### Sending tokens with Apollo clients

We recommend going to the specific documentation of the specific Apollo client you are using to know how to send tokens. However, the basics of this guide remains the same. Here is an example of how you would configure the Javascript/Typescript Apollo client to send the authorization token. The example is exactly the same as the one shown in the [Using Apollo clients](#using-apollo-client) section, but with the changes needed to send the token. Notice that `<AuthApiEndpoint>` and `<idToken>` are obtained from the [Authentication Rocket](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure).

```typescript
import { split, HttpLink, ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client'
import { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities'
import { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws'
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client'
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws'

function isSubscriptionOperation({ query }) {
  const definition = getMainDefinition(query)
  return definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' && definition.operation === 'subscription'
}

// CHANGED: We now use the AuthApiEndpoint obtained by the auth rocket
const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: '<graphqlURL>',
})

// CHANGED: We create an "authLink" that modifies the operation by adding the token to the headers
const authLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
  operation.setContext({
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <idToken>',
    },
  })
  return forward(operation)
})

// <-- CHANGED: Concatenate the links so that the "httpLink" receives the operation with the headers set by the "authLink"
const httpLinkWithAuth = authLink.concat(httpLink)

const subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient('<websocketURL>', {
  reconnect: true,
  // CHANGED: added a "connectionParam" property with a function that returns the `Authorizaiton` header containing our token
  connectionParams: () => {
    return {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <idToken>',
    }
  },
})
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink(subscriptionClient)

const splitLink = split(isSubscriptionOperation, wsLink, httpLinkWithAuth) // Note that we now are using "httpLinkWithAuth"

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: splitLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})
```

#### Refreshing tokens with Apollo clients

Authorization tokens expire after a certain amount of time. When a token is expired, you will get an error and you will need to call the [refresh the token](https://github.com/boostercloud/rocket-auth-aws-infrastructure#refresh-token) endpoint to get a new token. After you have done so, you need to use the new token in your GraphQL operations.

There are several ways to do this. Here we show the simplest one for learning purposes.

First, we modify the example shown in the section [Sending tokens with apollo clients](#sending-tokens-with-apollo-clients) so that the token is stored in a global variable and the Apollo links get the token from it. That variable will be updated when the user signs-in and the token is refreshed:

```typescript
import { split, HttpLink, ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client'
import { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities'
import { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws'
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client'
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws'

let authToken = undefined // <-- CHANGED: This variable will hold the token and will be updated everytime the token is refreshed

function isSubscriptionOperation({ query }) {
  const definition = getMainDefinition(query)
  return definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' && definition.operation === 'subscription'
}

const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: '<AuthApiEndpoint>',
})

const authLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
  if (authToken) {
    operation.setContext({
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`, // <-- CHANGED: We use the "authToken" global variable
      },
    })
  }
  return forward(operation)
})

const httpLinkWithAuth = authLink.concat(httpLink)

const subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient('<websocketURL>', {
  reconnect: true,
  // CHANGED: added a "connectionParam" property with a function that returns the `Authorizaiton` header containing our token
  connectionParams: () => {
    if (authToken) {
      return {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`, // <-- CHANGED: We use the "authToken" global variable
      }
    }
    return {}
  },
})
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink(subscriptionClient)

const splitLink = split(isSubscriptionOperation, wsLink, httpLinkWithAuth)

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: splitLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})
```

Now, _when the user signs-in_ or _when the token is refreshed_, we need to do two things:

1. Update the global variable `authToken` with the new token.
2. Reconnect the socket used by the subscription client by doing `subscriptionClient.close(false)`.

You might be wondering why we need to do the second step. The reason is that, with operations sent through HTTP, the token goes along with every operation, in the headers. However, with operations sent through WebSockets, like subscriptions, the token is only sent when the socket connection is established. For this reason, **everytime we update the token we need to reconnect the `SubscriptionClient`** so that it sends again the token (the updated one in this case).

### The GraphQL over WebSocket protocol

Sockets are channels for two-way communication that doesn't follow the request-response cycle, a characteristic feature of the HTTP protocol. One part can send many messages and the other part can receive all of them but only answer to some specific ones. What is more, messages could come in any order. For example, one part can send two messages and receive the response of the second message before the response of the first message.

For these reasons, in order to have an effective non-trivial communication through sockets, a sub-protocol is needed. It would be in charge of making both parts understand each other, share authentication tokens, matching response to the corresponding requests, etc.

The Booster WebSocket communication uses the "GraphQL over WebSocket" protocol as subprotocol. It is in charge of all the low level stuff needed to properly send subscription operations to read models and receive the corresponding data.

You don't need to know anything about this to develop using Booster, neither in the backend side nor in the frontend side (as all the Apollo GraphQL clients uses this protocol), but it is good to know it is there to guarantee a proper communication. In case you are really curious, you can read about the protocol [here](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).

:::note
The WebSocket communication in Booster only supports this subprotocol, whose identifier is `graphql-ws`. For this reason, when you connect to the WebSocket provisioned by Booster, you must specify the `graphql-ws` subprotocol. If not, the connection won't succeed.

## Cloud native

One of the goals of Booster is to become provider agnostic so you can deploy your application to any serverless provider like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc...

In the current version, we offer full support for AWS provider and experimental support for Kubernetes and Azure providers. We will eventually support all main cloud providers (**Contributions are welcome!** 😜)

### Configure your provider credentials

#### AWS provider

In AWS, it is required that your `~/.aws/credentials` file is properly setup, and a `region` attribute is specified. If you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html), you can create the config file by running the command `aws configure`, but that is completely optional, **AWS CLI is not required to run booster**.

This is an example of the minimal content your `~/.aws/credentials` file should have:

```text
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR KEY ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
region = eu-west-1
```

It's recommended to use IAM user keys and avoiding your root access keys. If you need help obtaining a `KEY ID` and `ACCESS KEY`, [check out the official AWS guides](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

### Deploy your project

To deploy your Booster project, run the following command:

```shell
boost deploy -e <environment name>
```

The `<environment name>` parameter is the name of the [environment](05_going-deeper#environments) you want to deploy.
It will take a while, but you should have your project deployed to your cloud provider.

If you make changes to your code, you can run `boost deploy -e <environment name>` again to update your project in the cloud.

To skip restoring dependencies after deployment you can run `boost deploy -e <environment name> -s`.

### Application outputs

After any deployment, an "Outputs" section will be printed to the console with useful information needed to interact with your application. The meaning of those outputs are:

- **httpURL**: This is the base HTTP URL of your application. You will need it to interact with the
  authentication/authorization API and the GraphQL API.
- **websocketURL**: This is the WebSocket URL you need to use to send GraphQL subscriptions.
- **clientID**: This parameter is _specific for the AWS provider_ (only shown if used AWS when deployint) and is
  needed only for the `auth/sign-up` and `auth/sign-in` endpoints.

### Delete your cloud stack

If you want to delete the Booster application that has been deployed, you can run:

```shell
boost nuke -e <environment name>
```

:::caution
This will delete everything in your stack, including databases. This action is **not** reversible!
:::

For a force delete without asking for confirmation, you can run `boost nuke -e <environment name> -f`.

:::danger
Be EXTRA CAUTIOUS with this option, all your application data will be irreversibly DELETED without confirmation.
:::

## Error handling

Booster includes a global error handler annotation `@GlobalErrorHandler` that will catch all errors that are thrown by:

- **Command Handling Errors**: Errors thrown by the `handle` method of the command.
  **Program handling errors**: Errors thrown by the ScheduledCommand `handle` method.
  **Event Handle errors**: Errors thrown by the `Event Handle` method.
- **Reducer errors**: Errors thrown by the `@Reduces` method of the entity.
- **Projection errors**: Errors thrown in the ReadModel `@Projects` method.
- All errors: Errors thrown in any of the previous methods. This method will always be called, also when calling any of the above methods.

You can trap and return new errors in any of these methods annotating a class with `@GlobalErrorHandler` and implementing the following methods:

**Command handle errors**:

```typescript
onCommandHandlerError?(error: Error, command: CommandEnvelope): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

**Schedule handle errors**:

```typescript
onScheduledCommandHandlerError?(error: Error): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

**Event handler errors**:

```typescript
onDispatchEventHandlerError?(error: Error, eventInstance: EventInterface): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

**Reducer errors**:

```typescript
onReducerError?(error: Error, eventInstance: EventInterface, snapshotInstance: EntityInterface | null): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

**Projections errors**:

```typescript
onProjectionError?(error: Error, entity: EntityInterface, readModel: ReadModelInterface | undefined): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

**All errors**

```typescript
  onError?(error: Error | undefined): Promise<Error | undefined>
```

Example:

```typescript
@GlobalErrorHandler()
export class AppErrorHandler {
  public static async onCommandHandlerError(error: Error, command: CommandEnvelope): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }

  public static async onScheduledCommandHandlerError(error: Error): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }

  public static async onDispatchEventHandlerError(error: Error, eventInstance: EventInterface): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }

  public static async onReducerError(
    error: Error,
    eventInstance: EventInterface,
    snapshotInstance: EntityInterface | null
  ): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }

  public static async onProjectionError(
    error: Error,
    entity: EntityInterface,
    readModel: ReadModelInterface | undefined
  ): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }

  public static async onError(error: Error | undefined): Promise<Error | undefined> {
    return error
  }
}
```

**Note**: if you want to ignore the error thrown, you can simply return `undefined` from the error handler.

## Migrations

### Schema migrations

Booster handles classes annotated with `@Migrates` as **Schema migrations**. The migration process will update an existing object
from one version to the next one.

For example, to migrate a `Product` entity from version 1 to version 2 we need the following migration class:

```typescript
@Migrates(Product)
export class ProductMigration {
  @ToVersion(2, { fromSchema: ProductV1, toSchema: ProductV2 })
  public async changeNameFieldToDisplayName(old: ProductV1): Promise<ProductV2> {
    return new ProductV2(
      old.id,
      old.sku,
      old.name,
      old.description,
      old.price,
      old.pictures,
      old.deleted
    )
  }
}
```

The `ProductV1` class is the old version of the `Product` object. You can keep your old clases in the same migration file, for example:

```typescript
class ProductV1 {
  public constructor(
    public id: UUID,
    readonly sku: string,
    readonly name: string,
    readonly description: string,
    readonly price: Money,
    readonly pictures: Array<Picture>,
    public deleted: boolean = false
  ) {}
}

class ProductV2 extends Product {}
```

### Data migrations

The decorator `@DataMigration` will indicate **Booster** that this class contains data migration code.

```typescript
@DataMigration({
  order: 2,
})
```

When the method `BoosterDataMigrations.run()` is call by the user, a new `BoosterDataMigrationStarted` event is emitted and **Booster** 
will check if there are pending migrations and, if so, run them in the order specified by the `order` value.

User should emit `BoosterDataMigrationFinished` manually at the end of each `DataMigration.start` method.

In `@DataMigration` classes, you can use `Booster.migrateEntity` method. This method will generate an internal event `BoosterEntityMigrated` before migrating the entity data.

This method will receive the old entity name, the old entity id and the new entity that we will be persisted. This way, you can migrate an entity id or rename it.

Example:

```typescript
@DataMigration({
  order: 2,
})
export class CartIdDataMigrateV2 {
  public constructor() {}


  public static async start(register: Register): Promise<void> {
    const entitiesIdsResult = await Booster.entitiesIDs('Cart', 500, undefined)
    const paginatedEntityIdResults = entitiesIdsResult.items

    const carts = await Promise.all(
      paginatedEntityIdResults.map(async (entity) => await Booster.entity(Cart, entity.entityID))
    )
    return await Promise.all(
        carts.map(async (cart) => {
          cart.cartItems[0].quantity = 100
          const newCart = new Cart(cart.id, cart.cartItems, cart.shippingAddress, cart.checks)
          await Booster.migrateEntity('Cart', validCart.id, newCart)
          return validCart.id
      })
    )

    register.events(new BoosterDataMigrationFinished('CartIdDataMigrateV2'))
  }
}
```
