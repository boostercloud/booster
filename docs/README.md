# Booster Documentation

## Introduction

### What is Booster?

### Booster Principles

### Why using Booster

## Getting started

### Installing Booster

You can develop with Booster using any of the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (Native and WSL)

#### Prerequisites

##### Install Node.js

The minimal required Node.js version is `v12`. Download the installer
[from nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/en/), or install it using your system's package
manager.

###### Ubuntu

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```

###### macOS

```shell
brew install node
```

###### Windows

```shell
choco install nodejs
```

Verify that it was installed properly by checking so from your terminal:

```shell
$ node -v
v13.12.0

$ npm -v
6.14.4
```

As soon as you have a Node.js version higher than `v12`, and an `npm` version higher than
`6`, you are good to go. Just note that `npm` comes with node, you don't have to install
it apart.

Alternatively, we recommend you to use a version manager for dealing with different Node.js
versions:

- [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Works with macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem
  for Linux
- [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - Works with native Windows

##### Set up an AWS account

This step is optional; Booster is a cloud-native framework, meaning that your application
will be deployed to the cloud using different cloud providers. By default, Booster uses the
[AWS Provider](framework-providers-aws), so you need an AWS account. You can always omit
this step if you only want to get a grip of Booster or test it locally without making a
deployment.

Note:
> Booster is free to use, but notice that the resources deployed to your cloud provider
> might generate some expenses.
>
> In AWS, all the resources generated by Booster are part of the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).
> When you're not eligible for the free tier, resources are charged on-demand. Deploying a
> Booster project and sending a few commands and queries should cost just a few cents.
>
> In any case, make sure to un-deploy your application with the command `boost nuke -e production`
> if you're not planning to keep using it.

Now it is a good time to create that AWS account, you can do so from
[the AWS console registration](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

Once you've registered yourself, you have to generate an access key for Booster. To do so,
login into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), and click on your account
name on the top-right corner.

![aws account menu location](./img/aws-account-menu.png)

A menu will open, click on **My security credentials** and it will take you to the
Identity and Access Management panel. Once there, create an access key:

![create access key button location](./img/aws-create-access-key.png)

A pop-up will appear, **don't close it!**. Create a folder called `.aws` under your home
folder, and a file called `credentials` with this template:

```ini
# ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR ACCESS KEY ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>
```

#### Installing the Booster CLI

Booster comes with a command-line tool that helps you generating boilerplate code,
testing and deploying the application, and deleting all the resources in the cloud. All
the stable versions are published to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boostercloud/cli),
these versions are the recommended ones, as they are well documented, and the changes are
stated in the release notes.

To install the Booster CLI run this:

```shell
npm install --global @boostercloud/cli
```

Verify the Booster CLI installation with the `boost version` command. You should get back
something like

```shell
$ boost version
@boostercloud/cli/0.4.1 darwin-x64 node-v13.12.0
```

### Your first Booster app in 10 minutes

In this section, we will go through all the necessary steps to have the backend up and
running for a blog application in just a few minutes. The steps to follow will be:

- [Create project](#1-create-the-project)
- [First command](#2-first-command)
- [First event](#3-first-event)
- [First entity](#4-first-entity)
- [First read model](#5-first-read-model)
- [Deployment](#6-deployment)
- [Testing](#7-testing)
  - [Creating posts](#71-creating-posts)
  - [Retrieving all posts](#72-retrieving-all-posts)
  - [Retrieving specific post](#73-retrieving-specific-post)
- [Removing stack](#8-removing-stack)
- [More functionalities](#9-more-functionalities)

#### 1. Create the project

First of all, we will use the Booster CLI to create a project. Run this command and follow
the instructions, when asked for the provider, select AWS as that is what we have
configured [here](#set-up-an-aws-account)

```shell
> boost new:project boosted-blog

...

ℹ boost new 🚧
✔ Creating project root
✔ Generating config files
✔ Installing dependencies
ℹ Project generated!
```

> Booster's new: commands follows this structure
>
> - `boost` is the Booster CLI
> - `new:<resource>` new is a CLI command, :project tells booster the kind of resource
> - `boosted-blog` is a parameter for the `new:project` command
> project name

The `new:project` command generates some scaffolding for you. The project name will be the
project's root so `cd` into it:

```shell
cd boosted-blog
```

There you should have these files and directories already generated:

```text
boosted-blog
├── .eslintignore
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── commands
│   ├── common
│   ├── config
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── entities
│   ├── events
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Now open the project in your favorite editor, e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### 2. First command

Commands define the input to our system, so we'll start by generating our first
[command](#commands) to create posts. Use the command generator in the project's root
directory as follows:

```bash
boost new:command CreatePost --fields postId:UUID title:string content:string author:string
```

The `new:command` generator creates a `CreatePost.ts` file in the `commands` folder:

```text
boosted-blog
└── src
    └── commands
        └── CreatePost.ts
```

As we mentioned before, commands are the input of our system. they're requested
by the users, validate the input, and store one or more events, so we have to
define two more things:

1. Who is authorized to run this command.
1. And what events are being triggered when the command is executed.

Booster allows you to define authorization strategies. We will cover that
later so, let's start by allowing anyone to send this command to our application
. To do that, add the string `'all'` to the the `authorize` parameter of the
`@command` decorator. Your `CreatePost` command should look like this:

```typescript
@Command({
  authorize: 'all', // Specify authorized roles here. Use 'all' to authorize anyone
})
export class CreatePost {
  public constructor(
    readonly postId: UUID,
    readonly title: string,
    readonly content: string,
    readonly author: string
  ) {}

  public handle(register: Register): void {
    register.events(/* YOUR EVENT HERE */)
  }
}

```

#### 3. First event

Instead of storing full objects, Booster stores data in the form of events, which are
records of facts and the source of truth. We will save an event called `PostCreated`
containing the initial post info. Any change to a given `Post` will be a new event
emitted, for example, `PostUpdated`.

For now, let's emit our `PostCreated` event once we have successfully handled
our `CreatePost` command. You can generate the event with this generator:

```bash
boost new:event PostCreated --fields postId:UUID title:string content:string author:string
```

The `new:event` command generates a new file under the `src/events` directory.
The name of the file is the name of the event:

```text
boosted-blog
└── src
    └── events
        └── PostCreated.ts
```

All events in Booster must target an entity, so we need to implement an `entityID`
method. From there, We'll return the identifier of the post created, the field
`postID`. This identifier will be used by Booster later to build the final state
of the `Post` automatically. Edit the `entityID` method in `events/PostCreated.ts`
to return our `postID`:

```typescript
// src/events/PostCreated.ts

@Event
export class PostCreated {
  public constructor(
    readonly postId: UUID,
    readonly title: string,
    readonly content: string,
    readonly author: string
  ) {}

  public entityID(): UUID {
    return this.postId;
  }
}
```

Now that we have an event, we can edit the `CreatePost` command to emit it. Let's change
the command's `handle` method to look like this:

```typescript
// src/commands/CreatePost.ts::handle
public handle(register: Register): void {
  register.events(new PostCreated(this.postId, this.title, this.content, this.author))
}
```

We can do any validation in the command handler before storing the event, for our
example, we'll just save the received data in a `PostCreated` event.

#### 4. First entity

So far, our `PostCreated` event suggests we need a `Post` entity. Entities are a
representation of the current state, so an Entity reduces all the events with the same
`entityID`. Let's then use the entities generator:

```bash
boost new:entity Post --fields title:string content:string author:string --reduces PostCreated
```

This time Booster has created a file called `Post.ts` in the `src/entities` directory.

The generator creates one reducer function for each kind of event. As we only have one
event yet, it will create one function. The reducer functions in Booster work similarly to
the `reduce` callback functions in Node: they receive an event and the previous state and
generate a new version of the state. When we receive a `PostCreated` event, we just return
a new `Post` copying the fields from the event:

```typescript
// src/entities/Posts.ts
@Entity
export class Post {
  public constructor(public id: UUID, readonly title: string, readonly content: string, readonly author: string) {}

  @Reduces(PostCreated)
  public static reducePostCreated(event: PostCreated, currentPost?: Post): Post {
    return new Post(event.postId, event.title, event.content, event.author)
  }
}
```

Entities represent the internal state of our system and can be queried from command or
event handlers to make business decisions or enforcing business rules.

#### 5. First read model

In a real application, we rarely want to publish our entire domain model (entities)
including all their fields. Also, different people may access one or other data depending
on their permissions. That's the goal of `ReadModels`. Client applications can query or
subscribe to them. A read model projects an entity so, let's project our `Post` and
produce a `PostReadModel`:

```bash
boost new:read-model PostReadModel --fields title:string author:string --projects Post:id
```

As you might guess, the read-model generator will generate a file called
`PostReadModel.ts` under `src/read-models`:

```text
boosted-blog
└── src
    └── read-models
        └── PostReadModel.ts
```

There are two things to do when creating a read model:

1. Define who is authorized to query or subscribe it
1. and filter out unneeded fields from the entity

Read models and commands compound the public API of a Booster application. With the
`CreatePost` command we authorized `all` to execute it, and this time we'll do the same
for the `PostReadModel`.

Just for learning, We also will exclude the `content` field from the `Post` entity so it
won't be visible.

To authorize anyone to query this read model, and filter out the content, edit the file to
look like this:

```typescript
// src/read-models/PostReadModel.ts
@ReadModel({
  authorize: 'all'// Specify authorized roles here. Use 'all' to authorize anyone
})
export class PostReadModel {
  public constructor(
    public id: UUID,
    readonly title: string,
    readonly author: string,
  ) {}

  @Projects(Post, "postId")
  public static projectPost(entity: Post, currentPostReadModel?: PostReadModel): PostReadModel {
      return new PostReadModel(entity.id, entity.title, entity.author);
  }

}
```

#### 6. Deployment

At this point, we've learned:

- how to create a publicly accessible command
- we emitted an event to store the data
- we reduced the event into an entity
- and finally, we projected the entity into a read model that is also publicly accessible.

That's all; you already know the basics to build event-driven, CQRS-based applications
with Booster.

Let's deploy our application to the cloud to see it working. It is as simple as running
the deploy command:

```bash
boost deploy -e production
```

It will take a couple of minutes to deploy all the resources. Once finished, you will see
information about your stack endpoints. For this example, we will only need to pick the
API endpoint. Look into the output for something like `backend-application-stack.baseRESTURL`
e.g.

```text
https://<some random number>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/graphql
```

We are close to testing our app, and to do so, we will use the GraphQL API endpoint.
Let's address that in the next section.

#### 7. Testing

Let's get started testing the project. We will perform three actions:

- Add a couple of posts
- Retrieve all posts
- Retrieve a specific post

Booster applications provide you with a GraphQL API out of the box. Commands are
mutations, and read models are queries. To perform calls to the GraphQL API, you can use
any HTTP client you want; we recommend you to use
[Postwoman](https://postwoman.io/graphql), which is free and includes great support for
GraphQL.

##### 7.1 Creating posts

Use your favorite GraphQL client to run these mutations. No authorization header is
required since we have allowed `all` to execute our commands and query the read models.

```graphql
mutation {
  CreatePost(
    input: {
      postId: "95ddb544-4a60-439f-a0e4-c57e806f2f6e"
      title: "Build a blog in 10 minutes with Booster"
      content: "I am so excited to write my first post"
      author: "Boosted developer"
    }
  )
}
```

```graphql
mutation {
  CreatePost(
    input: {
      postId: "05670e55-fd31-490e-b585-3a0096db0412"
      title: "Booster framework rocks"
      content: "I am so excited for writting the second post"
      author: "Another boosted developer"
    }
  )
}
```

The expected response for each of those requests should be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "CreatePost": true
  }
}
```

Note:

> In Booster, the IDs are generated on the client-side. When running production applications
> consider adding validation for ID uniqueness. For this example, we have used [a UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)

##### 7.2 Retrieving all posts

Let's perform a GraphQL `query` that will be hitting our `PostReadModel`:

```graphql
query {
  PostReadModels {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
```

It should respond with something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "PostReadModels": [
      {
        "id": "05670e55-fd31-490e-b585-3a0096db0412",
        "title": "Booster framework rocks",
        "author": "Another boosted developer"
      },
      {
        "id": "95ddb544-4a60-439f-a0e4-c57e806f2f6e",
        "title": "Build a blog in 10 minutes with Booster",
        "author": "Boosted developer"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### 7.3 Retrieving specific post

It is also possible to retrieve specific a `Post` by adding the `id` as input, e.g.:

```graphql
query {
  PostReadModel(id: "95ddb544-4a60-439f-a0e4-c57e806f2f6e") {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "PostReadModel": {
      "id": "95ddb544-4a60-439f-a0e4-c57e806f2f6e",
      "title": "Build a blog in 10 minutes with Booster",
      "author": "Boosted developer"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 8. Removing the stack

It is convenient to destroy all the infrastructure created after you stop using
it to avoid generating cloud resource costs. Execute the following command from
the root of the project. For safety reasons, you have to confirm this action by
writing the project's name, in our case `boosted-blog` that is the same used when
we run `new:project` CLI command.

```bash
> boost nuke -e production

? Please, enter the app name to confirm deletion of all resources: boosted-blog
```

Note:
> Congratulations! You've built a serverless backend in less than 10 minutes. We hope you
> have enjoyed discovering the magic of the Booster Framework.
