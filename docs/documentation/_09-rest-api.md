# Booster Cloud Framework REST API

The API for a Booster application is very simple and is fully defined by auth endpoints and the [commands](_03commands.md)
and [read models](_06read-models.md) names and structures.

After a successful deployment you'll see an "Outputs:" section in your terminal with several values that you need to use
when doing requests to the API. Those values are:

- `baseURL`: This is the base URL for all your endpoints
- `clientID`: Needed for authentication/authorization endpoints. This is only shown if there are roles defined in your app.

Note that the `Content-Type` for all requests is `application/json`.

## Authentication and Authorization API

The following endpoints are provisioned if your application have at least one role defined. For more information about how
to use roles to restrict the access to your application, see the section [Authentication and Authorization](_07auth.md).

### Sign-up
Register a user in your application. After a successful invocation, an email will be sent to the user's inbox
with a confirmation link. **Users's won't be able to sign-in before they click in that link**.
###### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<baseURL>/auth/sign-up
```
###### Request body
```json
{
	"clientId": "string",
	"username": "string",
	"password": "string",
	"userAttributes": {
   		"roles": ["string"]
	}
}
```
- _clientId_: The application client Id that you got as an output when the application was deployed.
- _username_: The username of the user you want to register. It **must be an email**.
- _password_: The password the user will use to later login into your application and get access tokens.
- _userAttributes_: Here you can specify the attributes of your user. These are:
    - _roles_: An array of roles this user will have. You can only specify here roles with the property `allowSelfSignUp = true`

###### Response
An empty body

###### Errors
You will get a HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.
For example, if you introduce a username that's not an email, you will get the following response body:
```json
{
    "__type": "InvalidParameterException",
    "message": "Username should be an email."
}
```

### Sign-in
Allows your users to get tokens to be able to make request to restricted endpoints.
Remember that before a user can be signed in into your application, **its email must be confirmed**

###### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<baseURL>/auth/sign-in
```
###### Request body
```json
{
	"clientId":"string",
	"username":"string",
	"password":"string"
}
```
- _clientId_: The application client Id that you got as an output when the application was deployed.
- _username_: The username of the user you want to sign in. It must be previously signed up
- _password_: The password used to sign up the user.

###### Response
```json
{
    "accessToken": "string",
    "expiresIn": "string",
    "refreshToken": "string",
    "tokenType": "string"
}
```
- _accessToken_: The token you can use to access restricted resources. It must be sent in the `Authorization` header (prefixed with the `tokenType`)
- _expiresIn_: The period of time, in seconds, after which the token will expire
- _refreshToken_: The token you can use to get a new access token after it has expired.
- _tokenType_: The type of token used. It is always `Bearer`
###### Errors
You will get a HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.
For example, if you tried to login a user that has not been confirmed, you will get the following response body:
```json
{
    "__type": "UserNotConfirmedException",
    "message": "User is not confirmed."
}
```
### Sign-out
Finalizes the user session by cancelling their tokens.

###### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<baseURL>/auth/sign-out
```
###### Request body
```json
{
	"accessToken":"string"
}
```
- _accessToken_: The access token you get in the sign-in call.

###### Response
An empty body
###### Errors
You will get a HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.
For example, if you specified an in valid access token, you will get the following error:
```json
{
    "__type": "NotAuthorizedException",
    "message": "Invalid Access Token"
}
```
